* Final words
	With this, I conclude my React roadmap, along with the knowledge I've built over the years about this amazing framework. Feel free to come back to it whenever you want to level up your React game. With React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and knowing a bunch of the libraries mentioned in this roadmap, you can build anything; there is no limit."
* What's next?
	* Get a job
		We both know a good step forward would be working alongside talented people and learning from them day in and day out. You can build a portfolio of some personal projects, create a resume, and try to apply to jobs, all while continuing to expand your knowledge of React.
	* Expend knowledge
		React here, React there, all I do is talk about React, but the truth is, whether you like it or not, you will have to expand your knowledge towards new technologies. That's what programming is all about. The more you know, the better you are. Maybe try these roadmaps next.
