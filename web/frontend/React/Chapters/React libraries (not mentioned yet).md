* Ui libraries
	React UI libraries are collections of pre-built UI components and tools designed to help developers create user interfaces quickly and efficiently in React applications. These libraries offer a wide range of components, such as buttons, forms, modals, navigation menus, and more, which can be easily integrated into React projects. I encourage you to pick one and use it, because it would be a waste of time to learn all of them. Navigo is built from scratch, no library used.
	* Material UI
		Material-UI is a popular React UI library that offers a collection of pre-designed, customizable components following Google's Material Design guidelines. It simplifies the process of building modern, visually appealing, and responsive user interfaces in React applications by providing a wide range of components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more, with a consistent and polished design.

	* Storybook
		Storybook is a development environment for building and testing UI components in isolation. It allows developers to create, showcase, and interact with individual UI components to ensure they work correctly and look as intended before integrating them into larger applications. Storybook helps improve component development and collaboration by providing a dedicated space to work on and showcase UI elements.

	* React helmet
		React Helmet as the name suggests, is managing the document head in a React application. This metadata plays a crucial role in how a web page is indexed by search engines and how it appears in search engine results. React Helmet allows you to dynamically and efficiently manipulate these head elements in response to changes in your React application's state. It helps when you are dealing with the SEO.
