* Why testing is important
	  Based on a real experience, when we started Navigo, we had to build an MVP, something small with basic functionality. Months later, when it came time to integrate, we discovered that not only were our backend and frontend not completely compatible, but even after making them compatible, we encountered thousands of bugs in the pre-release version. This was extremely time-consuming and energy-draining. If we had conducted E2E and unit testing from the beginning, we could have avoided these issues and saved valuable resources.

* Testing tools
	There are a lot of testing libraries out there I will point out the most popular and why are they used for
	* Jest
		Jest is a widely-used JavaScript testing framework, primarily designed for testing React applications. It is popular for its simplicity and comprehensive testing features. Jest offers built-in test runners, assertion libraries, and mocking capabilities, making it a one-stop solution for unit testing and integration testing. It also supports snapshot testing, parallel test execution, and code coverage reporting.

	* Cypress
		Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework specifically designed for web applications. It offers a unique and real-time interactive testing experience with an emphasis on simulating how a user interacts with a web page. Cypress is known for its easy setup, intuitive debugging, and automatic waiting for elements, making it a popular choice for testing the entire web application stack, including the UI.

	* Mocha
		Mocha is a flexible and popular JavaScript testing framework that can be used for testing both front-end and back-end applications. Mocha provides a simple and adaptable testing structure, supporting various assertion libraries and test runners. It's often chosen for its flexibility, allowing developers to choose their preferred tools for different testing needs.
