* What is a roadmap?
	Let's consider the analogy of navigating through a dense forest, aiming to reach a specific destination. Learning something new, like ReactJS, can be compared to exploring this unfamiliar terrain.

	Imagine you're equipped with a map or guide that outlines the phases of your journey. "Start by understanding the basics, represented by trees marked as 'A.' Once you've grasped those, move on to the 'B' trees. Eventually, you'll find that navigating through the 'C' trees, the more advanced concepts, becomes much smoother."

	This guide not only directs your path but also provides insights into alternative routes, suitable camping spots for breaks, and when to push ahead. Each camp represents a milestone in your learning journey.
	
* Is it the best you can get?
	While I have a strong preference for React, it's essential to acknowledge that the answer depends on the nature of the project you're undertaking. The suitability of React as a technology choice varies based on the specific requirements and goals of your project. React, a well-established library with a history in the industry, has stood the test of time and continues to evolve.

*  Learning is a marathon
	You should not try to "speedrun" this roadmap UNLESS you truly understand the concepts presented. Going over 10 things and not remembering any of them renders all of your effort useless. So learn constantly, make sure you understand the concept and you can implement it yourself and then got to the next one. And ALWAYS search for things that are not presented or might be missing in the roadmap, be as expansive as possible.
