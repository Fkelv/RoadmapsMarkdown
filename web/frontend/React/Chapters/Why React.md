* Mature simple-to-grasp dev workflow
	React is great for building websites because it makes coding easy and fast. You won't get confused with it since it is simple to learn. Unlike other frameworks, React keeps your code clean. It doesn't add extra stuff that makes your code messy. So, it helps you write code that's clear and easy to understand.

* Ultimate flexibility and compatibility
	Using React.js for web development is super handy because it's like learning one tool that you can use for many things. React is a natural library that helps create different parts of websites, like buttons, labels, and interactive features.

	One cool thing about React is that there are lots of people using it, so if you have questions, there's a big community to help out. With React, you can build not just regular websites but also desktop apps, mobile apps, static sites, and even things like VR and 360 views. And the best part is that every project follow similar rules and ideas making it easier to learn and use.

* Component based architecture
	Okay, so, in React.js, we use it to make different pieces of a website, called components. The cool thing is, once you make a component, you can use it again in other projects. It's like building with building blocks!

	Imagine you're building a big structure. Each small block (or component) has its own job and rules, but you can use them together to create something really awesome. This makes it easy to organise and improve your website, like putting together LEGO pieces. Plus, it helps a lot when you want to make similar things in other projects. So, building with React is like having a toolkit for making websites, and it's super flexible!

* JSX - easier DOM manipulation
	JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly in your JavaScript files. This simplifies the process of creating and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) in a more concise and expressive manner. In essence, JSX makes it easier to build user interfaces by combining HTML and JavaScript in a streamlined way.
