* Fetching data (choose one)
	While there are many libraries for fetching data, I find that these two are the most commonly used in React: Navigo, which utilizes the Fetch API. Both of them are extremely good options, so choose one that suits your needs.
	* Fetch API
		The Fetch API is a built-in web standard for making HTTP requests. Many developers use it directly, but it can also be used in combination with other libraries to simplify data fetching.

	* Axios
		Axios is a widely used library for making HTTP requests. It has a simple and intuitive API and can be used in both browser and Node.js environments.
