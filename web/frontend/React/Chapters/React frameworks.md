While I can't delve into the details of each framework, as they each deserve a roadmap of their own, it's worth noting that frameworks represent the 'new' way of building React applications. They offer additional utilities and many out-of-the-box features that were not readily available before. I'll briefly highlight when you should consider using each framework and their notable features. When building your next React app, you can evaluate which one best suits your project and make an informed choice.
