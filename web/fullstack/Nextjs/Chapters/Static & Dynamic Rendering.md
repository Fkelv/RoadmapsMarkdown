* In Next.js, static rendering refers to the process of pre-generating HTML files for web pages at build time. During the build process, Next.js analyzes the application, computes the necessary HTML content, and creates static HTML files for each page. These files are then served to users directly from a content delivery network (CDN), resulting in faster page loads, improved performance, and efficient use of server resources. Static rendering is particularly suitable for content that doesn't change frequently, offering a reliable and scalable solution for websites with static or semi-static content.

* Dynamic rendering in Next.js involves generating HTML content on the server in response to user requests. With dynamic rendering, pages are generated on-demand, allowing for real-time updates and personalization based on user input or external data sources. This approach is beneficial for content that requires frequent changes or is highly dependent on user interactions. Dynamic rendering strikes a balance between pre-rendered static content and fully dynamic content, providing flexibility for a wide range of web applications in Next.js.
