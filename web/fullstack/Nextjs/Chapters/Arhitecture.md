* In Next.js, the architecture of a project can follow different approaches based on the project's complexity, scalability requirements, and team preferences. Here's a brief overview of the mentioned approaches. Pick one suited for your needs.
* Modular
	* The modular approach involves organizing the codebase into small, self-contained modules or components. Each module typically represents a feature or a specific functionality. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and easy collaboration among developers. Each module can be developed and tested independently, making it a suitable choice for smaller to medium-sized projects.
* Feature-Sliced Design
	* Feature-Sliced Design is an architectural pattern that structures the codebase around features rather than layers. Each feature has its own directory containing all the components, styles, and logic necessary for that feature. This approach enhances separation of concerns and can lead to a more cohesive and maintainable codebase. It is especially beneficial for larger projects with many features.
* Monorepo
	* A Monorepo, short for Monolithic Repository, involves storing multiple projects or applications within a single repository. In the context of Next.js, this might include multiple Next.js applications, shared libraries, and other related projects. Monorepos simplify code sharing, versioning, and dependency management. They are particularly useful for large-scale projects with multiple interconnected parts.
* Monolith
	- A Monolith architecture involves building the entire application as a single, unified codebase. In the context of Next.js, this means having all pages, components, and logic within a single project. Monoliths are often simpler to set up and manage but can become challenging to scale and maintain as the project grows. They are suitable for smaller projects or when the simplicity of a single codebase outweighs potential scalability concerns.
