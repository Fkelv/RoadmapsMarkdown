* What is SEO?
	* SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of optimizing websites to improve their visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to enhance a website's relevance and authority in the eyes of search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo, making it more likely to appear higher in search results when users look for relevant information. SEO involves various strategies, including optimizing website content with relevant keywords, improving website structure and navigation, obtaining high-quality backlinks, and ensuring a positive user experience. By following SEO best practices, websites can attract more organic traffic, increase their online presence, and ultimately reach a larger audience through search engine queries.

	- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js supports SSR, allowing the server to pre-render pages with dynamic content before sending them to the client. This is beneficial for SEO as search engines can crawl and index fully rendered HTML content, improving page visibility and search rankings.
	- Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js supports SSG, enabling the generation of static HTML files during the build process. This not only enhances performance by serving static content from a CDN but also aids SEO by ensuring fast-loading pages and efficient crawling by search engines.
	- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): With ISR, Next.js allows specific pages to be regenerated at runtime without rebuilding the entire site. This is useful for frequently changing content, ensuring that the most up-to-date information is available to both users and search engines.
	- Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically implements code splitting, ensuring that only the necessary JavaScript is loaded for a specific page. This results in faster page loads, positively impacting user experience and SEO rankings.
	-  Image Optimization: Next.js provides built-in image optimization features, delivering images in modern formats and sizes based on the user's device. Optimized images contribute to faster load times, a crucial factor in SEO rankings.
	- Metadata Control: Next.js allows developers to easily manage metadata, such as titles and descriptions, for each page. Well-crafted metadata is essential for search engine results, providing concise and relevant information to users.
	- Structured Data Support: Implementing structured data (JSON-LD) in Next.js helps search engines better understand the content and context of the pages, leading to improved visibility in rich snippets and other SERP features.
	- Automatic Head Tag Management: Next.js automatically manages the `<head>` tag, simplifying the inclusion of essential SEO elements like title tags, meta tags, and canonical URLs.
