* How does routing work in nextjs
	In Next.js, the routing, folder system, and navigation work seamlessly together to simplify the development process. The `pages` directory serves as the foundation for routing, where each React component file automatically corresponds to a specific route. The hierarchical organization within the `pages` folder mirrors the URL structure, offering an intuitive way to manage routes.

* What is App Router
	In Next.js, the routing, folder system, and navigation work seamlessly together to simplify the development process. The `pages` directory serves as the foundation for routing, where each React component file automatically corresponds to a specific route. The hierarchical organization within the `pages` folder mirrors the URL structure, offering an intuitive way to manage routes. Navigation is facilitated by the Next.js router, which intelligently handles client-side transitions between pages.

* Server & client components
	Server Components enable the server-side rendering of dynamic and data-intensive content, optimizing performance and SEO. These components are processed on the server, ensuring that pages are fully rendered before reaching the client. This approach is ideal for content that remains relatively static and benefits from the efficiency of server-side rendering.
     Client Components in Next.js bring interactivity to the user interface by rendering components on the client side. This enables dynamic updates without requiring a full page reload, making it suitable for components that frequently change based on user interactions. The combination of Server and Client Components in Next.js provides a versatile and powerful approach, allowing developers to optimize performance where server-side rendering is advantageous and introduce dynamic elements on the client side for a responsive user experience.
