* Internationalization (i18n) 
	* Internationalization (i18n) in Next.js refers to the built-in capability that simplifies the process of adapting a web application to support multiple languages and regions. With i18n, developers can easily create a multilingual user interface by organizing and managing translated content, such as text and messages, through a centralized structure. Next.js provides tools for routing based on language preferences, loading translations dynamically, and maintaining a consistent user experience across different locales. This feature streamlines the development of applications that need to cater to a diverse audience, allowing for seamless localization and providing a foundation for delivering content in various languages while maintaining code maintainability and scalability.

* MiddleWare
	* In Next.js, middleware is a powerful concept that allows developers to intercept and modify the handling of requests before they reach their final destination. Middleware functions are executed during the server-side request processing phase and can perform tasks such as authentication, custom routing, or modifying the request and response objects. This provides a flexible and modular approach to extend and customize the behavior of the server. Middleware can be applied globally to affect all routes or selectively to specific routes, offering granular control over the server's functionality. With middleware in Next.js, developers can seamlessly integrate custom logic into the request-handling pipeline, enhancing the application's capabilities and allowing for the implementation of advanced features.
