 Back-end
- This section contains information on what you need to know to get started
  with backend development. You don't need to know everything in this
  subtree to get started, but it's important to have a basic understanding
  of the concepts listed here, so you can talk to people and get help if you
  get stuck working on a project.

- 1.B What is a protocol?
	- Protocols are the rules that govern how computers communicate with
	  each other. You should have a basic understanding of what a protocol
	  is and how it works to avoid headaches ahead.

	- 1.DB Common Backend Technologies
		- What technologies do backend developers use?
		  What skills do they need?
		- A list of things that are commonly used in backend development.
		  And most of what you'll be learning in this roadmap.
		- Languages & Frameworks
			- Be it Express, Django or any other framework, the easiest way
			  to get started with backend development is to use a framework.
			  Frameworks are a collection of libraries and tools that make
			  it easier to build applications by abstracting away the
			  complexity of the underlying technologies.
		- Databases & ORMs
			- Databases are used to store data. There are many different
			  types of databases, but the most common ones are relational
			  databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. and NoSQL databases
			  like MongoDB, Redis, etc. ORMs are used to interact with
			  databases. They allow you to write code instead of SQL queries
			  to interact with the database.
		- APIs & communication Protocols
			- APIs are used to communicate between different applications.
			  They allow you to send and receive data between applications.
			  There are many different types of APIs, but the most common
			  ones are REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and WebSockets.
		- Caching
			- Caching is used to store data in memory so that it can be
			  accessed faster. It's used to improve the performance of
			  applications by reducing the number of times data needs to be
			  fetched from the database or other external sources.
		- Identity & Access
			- Authentication is used to verify that a user is who they say
			  they are. Authorization is used to determine what a user can
			  and cannot do. This can be done using a variety of different
			  methods, but the most common ones are JWTs and OAuth.
		- Containerization
			- Containerization is used to package applications into
			  containers so that they can be run on any machine without
			  having to worry about dependencies or other external factors.
			  The most common containerization tool is Docker.
		- Cloud Providers
			- Cloud providers are used to host applications in the cloud.
			  They provide a variety of different services, but the most
			  common ones are storage, compute, and networking. The most
			  popular cloud providers are AWS, Azure, GCP and DigitalOcean.
