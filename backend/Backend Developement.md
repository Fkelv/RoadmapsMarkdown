1. Backend Development Intro
    - This section contains information on what you need to know to get started with backend development. You don't need to know everything in this section to get started, but it's important to have a basic understanding of the concepts listed here so you can talk to people and get help.

    - 1.A What is a server?
      - It's important to understand the concept of what a server is and how it works. This will help you understand how anything on the internet works. You may already have a vague idea if you're gamer, but could you really define what a server is?

    - 1.B What is a protocol
      - Protocols are the rules that govern how computers communicate with each other. You should have a basic understanding of what a protocol is and how it works to avoid headaches ahead.

        - 1.DB Common Backend Technologies
          - A list of things that're commonly used in backend development. And most of what you'll be learning in this roadmap.
          - Languages & Frameworks
            - Be it Express, Django or any other framework the easiest way to get started with backend development is to use a framework. Frameworks are a collection of libraries and tools that make it easier to build applications by abstracting away the complexity of the underlying technologies. 
          - Databases & ORMs
            - Databases are used to store data. There are many different types of databases, but the most common ones are relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Redis, etc. ORMs are used to interact with databases. They allow you to write code instead of SQL queries to interact with the database.
          - APIs & communication Protocols
            - APIs are used to communicate between different applications. They allow you to send and receive data between applications. There are many different types of APIs, but the most common ones are REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and WebSockets.
          - Caching
            - Caching is used to store data in memory so that it can be accessed faster. It's used to improve the performance of applications by reducing the number of times data needs to be fetched from the database or other external sources.
          - Authentication & Authorization
            - Authentication is used to verify that a user is who they say they are. Authorization is used to determine what a user can and cannot do. This can be done using a variety of different methods, but the most common ones are JWTs and OAuth.
          - Containerization
            - Containerization is used to package applications into containers so that they can be run on any machine without having to worry about dependencies or other external factors. The most common containerization tool is Docker. 
          - Cloud Providers
            - Cloud providers are used to host applications in the cloud. They provide a variety of different services, but the most common ones are compute, storage, and networking. The most popular cloud providers are AWS, Azure, GCP and DigitalOcean.

2. Server-side Programming
   - 2.A Choose a language
      - It's encouraged to pick a language and stick to it while starting out. It's less about which one you choose and more about learning to think like a programmer. Below are a few short videos of languages that are commonly used in backend development.
