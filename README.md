        - [Svelte](./web/frontend/svelte/Svelte.md)

These roadmaps can guide you from the very beginning to advanced topics in each
area.

## Recommandations
We use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to modify the files. We make sure the markdown it's mostly compatible with GitHub but you may see some oddities.

If you use obsidian to view the files you may want to install the following plugins:
- Dataview

if you want to contribute it may be helpful to additionally install:
- Advanced Tables
- Obsidian Copilot
- Terminal
