## Great! As you can see, Swift with its built-in support for writing asynchronous code makes it SO MUCH EASIER to learn, and it can also be pretty fun! For Part 2 of SwiftUI, we will dive deeper into a lot of complex usages of UI Elements, creating your own custom ones, deploying your app using a database and going over some Accessibility features
