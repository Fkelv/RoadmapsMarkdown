- I've talked before about what Protocols are and I've actually referenced them a lot throughout this roadmap, but now we'll do a deeper dive inside this concept. First of all, a Protocol defines a blueprint of methods or properties thatcan then be adapted by classes (or other types). One of the biggest benefits of using `Protocols` is actually the fact that multiple classes can abide by a single protocol. Let's suppose we have two objects `struct Dog { var breed: Labrador}` and `struct Cat { var breed: British Shorthair}`. Now, let's print their names. You'd have to do something like `func printOut(dog: Dog){ dog.breed }` and `func printOut(cat: Cat){ cat.breed }`. But, if you'd use a protocol, for example `Protocol Printing { var name: String { get } }`, and then you define the structs as protocolsof `Printing`: `struct Dog: Printing { var name: String }` and `struct Cat: Printing { var name: String }`, you could then use a single function to print both of their names, like so: `func printOut(object: Printing) { print(object.name) }.
