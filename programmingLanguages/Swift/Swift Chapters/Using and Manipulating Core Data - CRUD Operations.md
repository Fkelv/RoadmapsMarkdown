- This is another way to cache application data, just like UserDefault, BUT, this is used to add a LOT of data inside of it, unlike UserDefault which should be used only for very small pieces. We will also talk about CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/) is another Framework built by Apple and is very useful to save application data for offline use, cache temporary data (just like as I said with UserDefault), and also very importantly, to sync data across multiple devices using [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/)

- One thing that you need to know is that every App that uses Core Data has a [Core Data stack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/core_data_stack). A stack is a way of defining the relationships between multiple instances each responsible for different things within our app. I really insist on you understanding this concept, because many programmers just skip this entirely, but its crucial that you know how Core Data actually ticks behind the scenes.
