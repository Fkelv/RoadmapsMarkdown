- Another way in which you can define navigation is creating tab bars using TabView and PageTabViewStyle (e.g., YouTube iOS app at the bottom has a tab with buttons that when clicked navigate you to the Home / Explore / Profile pages), but they can also be used to create simple lists, carousels,  or other stuff.

- Besides the simple TabView and Lists, there's also the `.badge` [modifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/badge(_:)-6k2u9) that is used to provide supplementary information to the user. They can only be used in List rows, Tab Bars and Menus.
