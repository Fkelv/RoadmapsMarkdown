- Creating custom pipelines inside of your applications will 100% happen at some point in your developer journey. You can't always rely on the basic setup that SwiftUI provides if you want to build really complex and custom applications. Unfortunately, this can get really complex and may turn you away, but don't fret. Take a deep breath, rewatch a couple more times parts that you don't understand, post questions on forums with what you're finding hard, don't be afraid to seek for help. If you truly get to mastering this art, there's no doubt that you will create Swift Masterpieces in the not so far future.

- Talking about future, I also have to mention here the [Future](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/future) publisher class. Futures are used to convert regular escape enclosure functions into publishers, so you can freely use them in Combine.
