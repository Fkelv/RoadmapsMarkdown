- One other type of input are [Pickers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/picker). Pickers are controls for selecting from a set of values, and there are multiple types of them:
	- `Picker` - the default one that you create, by providing a selection, a label and the content from which to pick from.
	- `DatePicker`  and `MultiDatePicker`- this is a built-in view that allows the user to select a calendar date and a time, with the multi one allowing to pick multiple dates.
	- `ColorPicker` - as the name implies, it provides the iOS style color well from which you can choose any color you'd like.

- Another type of Pickers (you could think of it like this) are [Menus](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/menu).  They are basically the same, but you're the cool kid if you use Menus.
