- Another type of dialog pop-ups that you might need to use at some point within your app are [ContextMenus](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/contextmenu(menuitems:)), but, the way these are triggered is by the user of the app doing an actual gesture (like tap and hold) on an object. For example, everytime you go on WhatsApp and you tap and hold a chat, a preview will appear of the chat, alongside a Context Menu.
