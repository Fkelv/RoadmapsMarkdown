- While we have been talking a lot about methods to manipulate data, manipulate the UI with Views, user onboarding and a bunch of other stuff, we didn't talk about how to actually have a database behind your app which you can access and use, and I'll only talk about Firebase in our case, but keep in mind that there are other options (MySQL, SQLite, Realm etc). I've provided a simple tutorial for you, but I'd also recommend checking out the playlist down below:
	- [Firebase Database in a Swift App](https://youtu.be/tpsffoRh9u0?si=txw-C0ZICZ81Ot37)
	- [SwiftUI + Firebase | Swiftul Thinking Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4Vfkdphl8ly0oi0aHx0v2B7UvDK0&si=s53PFqwpFagA0wq8)
- Now that you actually have a database, and you (presumably) finished work on your own app, you have to know that for you to deploy it to the AppStore is a very complicated process, but first comes debugging on your own iPhone device. Why should you do that? Well, sometimes you will find that there are bugs that will only appear when using the app on the device, not in the Simulator from Xcode. While the Simulator is a controlled environment, your iPhone isn't (kind of), so all sorts of things can happen.
