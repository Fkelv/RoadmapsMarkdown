- Now, in iOS applications, you want to sometimes store data inside of the application cache, using the `@AppStorage` property wrapper. [AppStorage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/appstorage) is useful for restoring the state of the application when a user closes it, and is generally used to reflect User Defaults values, useful for storing, for example, if a user is signed in or signed out of your app.

- To better understand AppStorage and how you can use it to its full potential, alongside revising pretty much everything you have learned about so far, Swiftul Thinking has a really awesome video where he builds a 'dating app' where a user can sign up, add their name, age, gender, and also log into the application, with some cool usages of Transitions and a bunch of stuff. This is optional, you don't need to watch it, but I advise you to at least glance through it because a lot of the concepts are revised in a beautiful way by actually building an application and they are explained to you very well.
