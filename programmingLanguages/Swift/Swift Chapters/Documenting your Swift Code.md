- Great! You've finished all of the technical stuff about SwiftUI. Next, we will talk, as promised before, about Swift Concurrency and how you can use a database like Firebase to create a fully functional app for iOS that you can then test on your own mobile device. But, firstly, I want to talk to you about adding documentation for your code. As you could see throught this roadmap, there are a lot of link to the official Apple Developer Documentation. Now imagine that there wouldn't exist documentation at all. It's just like IKEA sending you a floating bed with drawers but without giving you any instructions at all on how to assemble it. Even with the instructions, they are hard to do and take countless hours, but think about the horror that would await you without instructions at all! You really need to document your code if you want others or you in 5 years time to be able to quickly and easily read and understand the code that YOU yourself have written, and Swiftful Thinking again provides us with a great guide on ways you can do that.
