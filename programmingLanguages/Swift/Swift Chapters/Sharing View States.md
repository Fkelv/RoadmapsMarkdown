- As I said before, if you want to share states between views, you'll be much better off by using either `@ObservedObject` or `@EnvironmentObject`. And for now, all you need to know is that EnvironmentObjects should only be declared for data used externally throughout the app, kind of like a 'Global' variable that can be accessed from any View from anywhere within the application,. ObservedObject should be used so that other Views can check and update their state according to the object we're observing, and only variables marked with the `@Published` property wrapper will trigger rerenders of the View that's watching the object. But something very important to know is that YOU CAN NOT DEFINE OBJECTS USING OBSERVEDOBJECT! This is very important, because Swift might get confused and accidentally destroy your object alltogether, and you should use `@StateObject` for creating instances of objects. This can be very confusing for new developers, and I've struggled with this in the past as well, but please write this down somewhere on your desktop or on a notebook or wherever you feel like you'll get to see it a lot, because this is very important.
