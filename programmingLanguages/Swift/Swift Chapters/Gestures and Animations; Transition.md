- One great way of providing interactability with your app to the user is to create custom gestures inside of your app. Gestures are functions used too create long-presses, swipes, zooms, rotations, or drags within an application view. Everything from swiping right on an email to dragging a song to the top of the queue inside of the YouTube app is done through interactive gestures that are tailor to the YouTube application.

- Designing your app can be a tough challenge, and one *KEY* element for making your app feel nice to use is animations, and, luckily, SwiftUI has a very simple way of defining and customizing visual transitions from one state to another. There are multiple types of animations, such as `linear`, `easeIn`,`easeOut`, `spring`, and the way you use them is entirely subjective. The properties of animations which you can customize are timings, curves, adding a delay, making it repeat indefinitely or for some set amount of times, or whatever you would ever think of. Animations are one great way of adding character to your application, so try and get creative with them!
