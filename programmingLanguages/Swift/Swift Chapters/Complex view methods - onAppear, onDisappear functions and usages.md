- Now, let's talk about Complex View methods starting with `.onAppear()` and `.onDisappear` functions. As their name suggests, the functions add an action to perform before the view appears, or after the view appears. Let's say that for example, on navigolearn website on Explore page you can see that there are cards for each different roadmap on the website, and inside of each card you can see a like counter. Well, you wouldn't want for the database to pull that data before the roadmap card is actually visible on the screen, so this is a perfect way to use `.onAppear()` to make sure that you only call the data when the card appears on the screen.
