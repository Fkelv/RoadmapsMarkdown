- So, you've already learned about transition animations and adding sheets (a view on top of an existing view), but, let's say that for example you want to change the keyboard language on your iPhone. For that, you'd have to go to Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards. And, as you can tell, the system isn't adding sheets on top of sheets on top of the main view, because that would be horrible, like? Well, here's where NavigationStacks come into play (previously known as NavigationView, but that's became deprecated in iOS 17) and NavigationLinks. NavigationStack is used for creating a flow for a list of data items, just like the example I've given you before. The Settings app has a bunch of sub-menus, for which sheets cannot be used for, because they would break the flow of the entire application. One thing to keep in mind is that a NavigationStack requires NavigationLinks in order to function. Think of a Stack as the capital of a country, and the roads the actual NavigationLinks that makes possible the transition, for example, from Bucharest to Cluj-Napoca (but without all of that horrible traffic and road pavement and ugly people and bad drives and.. sorry, I had a breakdown)
