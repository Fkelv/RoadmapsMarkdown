- Damn, you've finally did it. You reached the end. Congratulations! Took way longer than you first hoped for, huh? Well, as you could already see, Swift is a very vast and complex programming language, but, the easy-to-find documentation and video tutorials provide you with a bunch of tools useful for learning, but, one thing to keep in mind is that with every new OS version, Apple adds a bunch of improvements to Swift and sometimes also removes or provides replacement for functions and methods in all of their Frameworks. Altough I've covered most of the stuff available currently in Swift, there's no telling when some things will get deprecated or better alternatives will be available. For now, a final project for you could be this Crypto App playlist, but it's optional. What I'd do in your place is explore my horizon. There's no better alternative to learning than to practice and write Swift code yourself, and by building an app from the ground-up all by yourself. Me, personally, I tried to create a SoundCloud alternative with better UI and animations. It was a fun project that I enjoy, and I plan on releasing the repo for it on GitHub in the future after I finish it, because right now it's in a rougher shape :D
