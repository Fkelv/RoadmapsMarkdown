- A key thing with managing very complex views is to try to keep as much logic as possible inside of functions outside of the View. Let's say that, for example, you are developing a game and whenever a user completes a level, what might happen is for a victory screen to appear, show some stats, then a loading screen, then the actual loading of the next level should happen, and then the start screen of the level and the rest. But, this WILL get so complex that if you write all the logic inside of the View function, your code will be so hard to read and you won't be able to keep track of it. What I'd recommend is making sure that you keep your code as clean as possible, by using what are known as subviews, and by extracting functions outside of your View.
