- [Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures/#) are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Closures are called "Escaping Closures" when they are used by passing them as an argument to a function, but they are called after the function returns. Escaping Closures are marked by the `@escaping` argument. They are useful because while they do start inside of a function, you can freely use them outside of that said function, even after the function has ended or returned an output.

- [Autoclosures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures/#Autoclosures) is an automatically-created closure used to wrap a piece of code. It's a way to delay the execution of closure until it is actually needed. They are also often used as an argument to a function where the closure is optional or where the cloosure's execution may not always be necessary.
