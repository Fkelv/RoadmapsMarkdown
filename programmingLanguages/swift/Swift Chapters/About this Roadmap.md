First of all, this roadmap is suited for all people, including those who have never touched coding before. This course starts at level 0, and we will go all the way to level 50 final boss (not level 100 in-depth, but I will give you other tools to work with and get there), but I'd like you to keep some things in mind when starting to learn Swift:
1. Do not fear exploring on your own. This roadmap includes a few basic projects and an advanced one, but these don't have to be your only apps that you build. You can, and I strongly advise you, to try building your own ideas so you also exercise your mind and train your problem-solving ability engrained in your brain that you will 100% need in the future of your coding joruney.
2. ALL of the sources used for this roadmap are FREE! You don't have to pay for anything, learning online has never been simpler than it is now, there are a lot of materials out on the web from courses, to books, to forum posts, Stackoverflow answers and even video courses out on YouTube. The Swift Community is full of people willing to help you out, never forget this, and never be ashamed to ask for help!
3. Take as much time as you feel is needed while learning. I get that most people like to 360 no-scope a programming language in less than 2 hours, but that's not the way things work here. Most of the stuff that will be talked about should be taken as tasks that you have to do yourself. It isn't enough to just glance at the material and memorize my words. You have to go out there and try these concepts yourself until you've mastered each one of them. One great way of keeping track of things is using the node's Status system. And please don't try to do 5 things at once, it doesn't work like that. Go one at a time and figure them out, but make sure you do revise these stuff maybe once every week since starting, and if you have the time you can also try taking notes from the roadmap to get your brain to remember especially the important stuff.
4. Here is a list of a few material that I probably will reference at some point in the roadmap, or places worth visiting for learnig new stuff about Swift. Think of it as a "bibliography"
