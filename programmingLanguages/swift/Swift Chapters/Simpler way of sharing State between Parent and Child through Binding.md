- Do note that sharing views between a parent and a child view can also be done using the `@Binding` property wrapper. For example, let's suppose that we have a main view in a restaurant app that displays an image of the menu item you're about to order in the background (let's call this `var menuImage`, and a subview that contains the actual list of the menu items which you can scroll through. Let's say you select Chicken Strips with French Fries, the background image of our main view should upgrade to the picture of the Chicken Strips. But, your subview with the menu items should be able to let the main view know that the image should be updated, so we will declare the value inside of the subview using `@Binding menuImage`. But remember, this only works within a parent-child relationship for views.
