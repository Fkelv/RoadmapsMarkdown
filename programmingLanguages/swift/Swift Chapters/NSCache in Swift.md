- Another type of caching class object in Swift is [NSCache](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nscache).  But, the key thing with this type ofcaching is that it is not permanent, will not persist between sessions, and it's used to store key-value pairs that may be deleted in case of low resources on the user's phone. Typically, we use this cache for storing objects that are very difficult to create and they are better off being used stored in cache for providing performance benefits, since the values of these objects do not have to be recalculated. But, as I stated before, these objects may be deemed not necessary by the application and they will be discarded in case of low memory. Swiftful Thinking has an example of storing Images in an SwiftUI app. I know I've mentioned this YouTube chanel quite a few times in this roadmap, but he just really is that good at explaining the concepts and giving examples of when you should use each concept.
