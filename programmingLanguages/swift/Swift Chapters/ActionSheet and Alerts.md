- Continuing with the types of ways you can present information to a user, in SwiftUI we also have [Alerts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/alert(_:ispresented:presenting:actions:message:)-8584l) and [Action Sheets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/confirmationdialog(_:ispresented:titlevisibility:presenting:actions:message:)-8y541) They are very similar in terms of what they actually do, but the main thing is that an Alert usually only has an 'OK' and 'Cancel' button, whilst Action Sheets present the user with multiple options, beyond 'OK' and 'Cancel'. The way these two functions work was changed in iOS15 and is deprecated now, so please check the articles regarding the way you use them in the new and updated versions.
