- In this roadmap, we'll talk about two ways which you can download data in Swift
	- The first one is by using [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession), which is a class object that coordinates a group of related, network data transfer tasks. 
	- The second one is by using the [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) Framework. This framework provides a Swift API that processes values over time, which can represent many kinds of asynchronous events, by using what's known as [Publishers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) and [Subscribers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber). Publishers provide data which can then be accesed by Subscribers
- Do keep in mind that you can create Custom Publishers yourself, but, there are very specific edge cases and most of the time you'll use this, the publishers given acces to you by the Combine framework will be more than enough.
