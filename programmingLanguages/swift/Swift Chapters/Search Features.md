- Not so long ago, with iOS 16, Apple also introduced a bunch of new Search features. Unfortunately, in typical Apple fashion, the search modifiers aren't that customizable, but, they work and they work blazingly quick. One of the awesome feature of MacOS and iOS that I couldn't live without is the [Spotlight Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(Apple)). The way it effortlessly finds files, words in Notes, pictures relating to what you're searching, Messages and so on is awesome and it's a really nice feature that you could add to your App.
- All you need to do to add a search interface to your app is applying one of the searchable view modifiers inside of your NavigationStack or a view inside of it, by using `.searchable()`
- Search can be a bit customizable by using Search Scopes - they basically define that your searchable data falls inside of a few categories (e.g., Fruits, Vegetables in a Supermarket) and another way to make user interactability with your app is by also doing search suggestions. All of these are covered in the video below.
