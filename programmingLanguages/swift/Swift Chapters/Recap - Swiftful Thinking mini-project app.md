By now, you can officially call yourself a (semi)Master at Swift and I want you to take a look at Swiftful's mini-project app, which recaps most of the stuff I've talked about here. In the next parts of the roadmap, we'll dive into accessibility features, and, most importantly, actually deploying your app.
