- New in iOS 17, Apple introduced the [SensoryFeedback](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/sensoryfeedback) view modifier, marked by `.sensoryFeedback()` which can now represent simple haptics useful for example to let the user know that a task has succeeded or if an error is present. This could be useful, for example, in a To-Do App for marking tasks as completed.

- Simple sound effects can also be easily added inside of our application using the [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/) framework built by Apple. You can simply import it into your app and use something like `AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(1026)`, where 1026 is the SystemSound id, for simple alerts and or notification sounds within your app. If you want to add custom sounds, you should instead use [AVKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avkit) Framework.
