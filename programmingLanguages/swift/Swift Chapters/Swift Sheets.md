- Now that we know how to add and customize animations and transition to our app, another *KEY* element that developers use when building applications are what's known as Sheets. They are used for when you want to present a new view on top of another already existing one, while allowing users to dismiss the new view after they are done with it. This can be done using the `.sheet()` function.
