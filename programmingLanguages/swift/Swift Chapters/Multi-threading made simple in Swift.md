- The concept of multi-threading is not uncommon in the world of technology. In Swift, you can easily achieve this by using [Dispatch Queue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue). DispatchQueue is an object that manages the execution of tasks not on the main thread, but instead on a background thread, so that your main thread is not overloaded, which will then cause your app to lag, freeze, or sometimes even crash. One thing to note is that you cannot create background threads infinitely, because it won't work.
