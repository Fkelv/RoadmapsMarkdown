- Another *KEY* element in building Swift Applications is the [AsyncImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage) view. What it basically does is it waits for the image to load before actually displaying it on the screen. You will find out more about Swift Asynchronous methods when we will talk about all aspects of Swift Concurrency, but for now, let's finish with the SwiftUI stuff. A clever trick that this View uses is that while the image is still loading, the view will display a placeholder that fills the space which will then be occupied by the image, and the neat part about this is that you can actually use custom placeholders using the `placeholder: {}` property of the AsyncImage view.
