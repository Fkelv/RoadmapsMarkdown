For problem solving
Problem solving is not defined by something clear, it is an abstract notion that cannot really be mastered by anyone, only barely touched. The only thing that will truly help you is thinking deeply and pushing your limits by making projects or solving some challenges.

0. How to learn web development and not lose your mind - What you are seeing in this roadmap is a HUGE amount of information. Web development is notoriously complicated to get started with, having a very complicated ecosystem. Despite this you should not feel discouraged. You should NOT KNOW everything especially as a beginner, what you should aim instead for about 50-70% of this roadmap topics is to "know that they exist" and have an idea of how they work. You should master you core that being javascript, html, css and a web framework and if you continue to be curious the rest will come along. I highly recommend going through all of the videos/resources and code along or at least be focused and understand everything and WHY it is done the way it is. I also left in many descriptions more humanly explanations for some concepts.

1. Internet and web - Internet powers our modern world and technologies. It is all around us and it is a good idea to understand it regardless of your professional activities. That being said, for frontend development you need to have a good grasp of at least the basics of the internet in order to start. I've selected what I deemed to be most relevant for this domain, since networking is a very large field
   A - How does the internet work?

   	1. Internet explained in 5 minutes - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc 
   	2. How the internet works #1 (HTTP) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW2A5SZ3GkI&list=PL0yztVlNIsg6o9LnrSwJdJetwWV2ZpCLj&index=2

   	4. How does the internet works #3 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYXAxXjaKws&list=PL0yztVlNIsg6o9LnrSwJdJetwWV2ZpCLj&index=4

   B - What if the internet never existed

   	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tszFFafk8pA
   C - Networking course - Definitely not necessary, but I highly recommend this course, it really gives you insight into networking and a more broad base of knowledge about the internet. Feel free to skip it or watch it later if you want to advance faster through the roadmap.

   	1. Computer networking course - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvYjXCsTg8

2. Html
   A - Html basics - HTML is a markup ( not programming ) language that it's used to structure the blocks of a webpage. It is the clear starting point in web development

   	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD13eq_Pmp8 - HTML course
   	2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok-plXXHlWw -  HTML in 100 seconds

   B - A taste of SEO- Despite not being important in the beginning, learning to do html the right way from the start can be of great advantage. So make sure to brush up this chapter at least

   	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSm4aQl4w_U - Seo basics

   C - Html Semantic elements

   	 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOUhq46fd5g

3. CSS
   A - Basics

   	1. I have yet to meet someone who tells me "Yes I know css". Try to understand how it works, not to master it, that will come with time. Right now you need only a grasp of its way of working
   	2. Bro code css - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRNinF7YQqQ

   B - Master your layouts ( or regret you didn't do it )

   	3. Understanding the quirks that surround css is quite tricky, but mostly you have to know how those damn div's interact with eachother in different situations. I highly advise to take a good look at all these videos
   	4. Secret to css layouts - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuSz4fRM88
   	5. The joy of css grid - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705XCEruZFs

4. Javascript -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOChLn5ZdQ
   A - Basics of javascript - The basics of one of the most despised programming languages. The basics of the programming language made in 10 days. Despite its quirks and oddities, javascript remains one of the most widely used programming languages today, so you should better learn it, so you will now know how a programming language shouldn't look

   	4. Event listeneres  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF1_MlZ5l6M

   C - What the hell is nodejs? - I remember as a beginner hearing all these terminology about javascript and nodejs, but believe when I say I took at least a few months to actually differentiate between javascript and nodejs. In a nutshell javascript is a language that runs INSIDE the browser ( eg google-chrome ), while nodejs is THE ENGINE OF THE BROWSER extracted outside the browser to run javascript. Nodejs is generally used to build backends and server-side apps, BUT you can also write frontend code by writing Nodejs code and then using a MODULE BUNDLER to TRANSPILE it to plain vanilla javascript. Both 1. writing classic js or 2. using nodejs + a module bundler are valid ways of delivering a frontend application although the latter is a standard at this point. While Node.js itself isn't running in the browser, its ecosystem is instrumental in modern front-end development processes. It's like using a sophisticated toolset to build a car; the tools themselves aren't part of the car, but you wouldn't have the final product without them.

   E - 100 javascript concepts - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU&t=0s
   F - What is ecmascript ? - You should think of ecmascript like a BLUEPRINT and javascript as a language that follows that blueprint. Don't confuse the 2 of them

   	1. Javascript and Ecmascript - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAdxWX7s3PY
   	2. ES6 modules - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRHQNNcYf6s

5. How to do cool graphics-  There are a number of ways to achieve animations, graphics and effects on a website. Here are presented a few of those methods, but mostly they can be divided in 3 categories: Canvas graphics, Svg graphics and plain Js + css animations.  Svg is a container for vector based graphics which are easier in general to handle than canvas and "classic" animations are well, classic. They all have pros and cons so chose wisely. Also REMEMBER, All of the things listed above can be combined with each other !!

   A - Canvas - Canvas is well, a canvas on which you can "paint". The paint is done at each frame generally using requestAnimationFrame, and you have to repaint every second the newly moved or changed objects. Canvas is a low-level, flexible, efficient but hard to develop on solution

   	1. Learn canvas api - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm1QtePAYTM
   	2. Canvas particle animations -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAJEHf92tV0

   B - Svg - Svg is a container for vector graphics. Svgs are widely used as icons in websites, but they can also have their own internal logic that handles the animations and transitions between vectors. There are also multiple websites that can generate Svgs that you can use in your code.  They are easier to manipulate than a canvas and highly customizable, but less performant especially for high number of objects.

   	2. Awesome Svg animation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHgr6NLeEw
   	3. Beautiful Svg curves - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPJVi797Uy0
   C - Javascript + css -  The "classic" way of doing things, which has probably the most free-styling and multiple ways of achieving the same result. Keep in mind that javascript + css can be combined with svgs and canvas too so don't keep them separate if it makes sense to combine them.

   	2. Professional scrolling effect - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_JKlr4WKKs


5.  Javascript runtimes - See the "What the hell is nodejs" node for a more detailed explanation

    3. Bun ( it's buntime ) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWqNgzZwVJQ


6. Package managers - Package managers help us install and use other people's code. As simple as that! There are a few package managers out there, but npm is the most popular.
   1. What is npm ? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3aKRdUyr0s
   2. Why I switched to pnpm ? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1E31WPR70g

7. Bundling and transpilation tools - There are a set of tools that you need to know about and those are bundle tools and transpilers. Bundle tools take all your code and bundle it into a nice, thick set of optimized js, while transpilers ( babel being the most popular ) take javascript code and convert it into the old version that is compatible with all the browsers. For the most part you won't take any of these since they are automated in most frameworks, but you should have an idea of what they do and how they work.

   A. Frontend development setup  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs&t=0s


Project alarm ! - remember you need to always fix the information you have aquired and you've been hard at it!
Lets see some ideas. You should do at least one of these, preferably 2 of them.

1. The div race - Make 2 divs that race with each other !! One is controlled by an evil wizard which can accelerate the div speed with 10 pixels per second. The other is controlled by you! You have 2 buttons on the website. The first one needs can make your div move by 50 pixels per second, while the other will reset the speed of the other div to 0 ( so the wizard will start accelerating the div again ). Your goal is to make this website  work and win the game ! Good luck ! Tip: use a recursive setTimeout for the wizard functionality
2. Playlist saving app - A spiced up to do list that allows link embedings. You have to create a website in which you can: add, remove and edit playlist entries. An entry has a title and a link associated to it. You can edit both the title and the link of any entry. You can add and delete entries. You will also have a view-only mode in which you have the list of entried you can click that will send you over to the specific link
3. Make a sorting algorithm visualizer - Well if you do this one you can truly say you mastered the previous chapters and you can easily create a above average website. This one is part of a project that got Clement Mihailescu into google ( the founder of algoexpert.io ). You can see the video where he is presenting the project here. Your goal is to implement one of the algorithms in the sorting part. But if you see any other one you like, you should be able to do those too instead

10. CSS advanced - A list of the professional ways you can write css. I found tailwind to be the most useful if you have a specific design for your website. UI libraries can be helpful if you want quick components that look fine for your projects or your company already uses one. Saas is basically css on steroids.

    A - Tailwind CSS - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr15Xzb1Ook
    B - UI libraries -  Components libraries that you can use out of the box in your projects. These are some of the 3 most popular ones. They can be used in any project and are not specific to a framework

    	1. Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
    	2. Shadcn UI - https://ui.shadcn.com/
    	3. Bulma - https://bulma.io/

    C - Saas  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDIJa0AP5c


11. Javascript Advanced - This section has some more advanced topics related to javascript
    A - Asynchronous javascript - Javascript functions such as api calls, fetching data or setTimeout can be asynchronous, so they don't behave like normal functions. I strongly recommend seeing the event loop video first as it is the best explained one can imagine. Down below I also

    	1. Must see - asynchronous javascript - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z7FjG--F20
    	2. Async explained episode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3tm0quoqE
    B - Event loop and concurrency - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ
    C - Closures - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJpN5FAeF4
    D - Fetch API - This is the standard way of getting or "fetching" data from an external server. You need a good idea of how asyncronous functions work in order to use this it. There are multiple libraries built on top of it such as axios that help abstract way some complexity

    	1. The fetch API - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drK6mdA9d_M
    	2. Get data from a REAL APi - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUcc4vW-jsI



12. Testing - Like it or not, testing is an industry standard. Now WHY you should test your apps? Well,  for simple apps is mostly useless. The true value of testing appears when you have big apps, with multiple modules interacting with each other and you make a change and without knowing it you broke 3 features while adding the 4th. So you go back and fix the 3 initial features and now they work with the 4th one, but 2 unrelated things are not working anymore because of that code. This is an extreme example, but truth is a solid set of tests can ensure that your app still works after adding or changing something.

13. Javascript frameworks of never ending pain - As one great man said "Anything that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript", so were the tens of frameworks that are floating around at the moment. At this point in your journey you have to quite a few choices that can be simplified to this: Reactjs is the biggest one and the daddy of them all, also the most widely used. After that you have Angular ( which has been in decline for a while ) and Vue which seems to be growing gradually. On the other side there are the hot new frameworks. There are a lot of these but the most widely recognized is svelte. Ideally a well-rounded web developer should have at least a grasp of 2 frameworks, my personal recommendations being svelte and react to start with, but feel free to chose any of them -

    8.B Established frameworks
    2. React - Biggest framework, the definitive king right now. Even tough many people say it's too bloated and that you have to write too much code, the fact that is a bit on the lower level side of things gives you a lot of insight into the component based and reactive thinking that all these frameworks are built upon.

    8.E How to learn everything without learning everything?  - Here I want only to only to give a few tips and tricks that I've learned over the time. So how do you learn everything without doing it? Sounds impossible right? But think like this: At first you have 3 frameworks, let's say react, svelte and vue. You might say require independent learning session from each other and you would be right in some sense. But after you learn react for example, you will know about useState, useEffect hooks which are react specific, BUT you should also understand the underlying ideas and thinking that goes into these hooks and why they are the way they are. For example useState is a hook made to holBuild toolsd a state on a reactive page. If you understand what reactivity means, why it's useful and why it's used, you will also have a grasp of ALL the other frameworks like svelte and vue when you hear the words reactivity and state. Because if you dig deep enough in any framework or tool you will eventually find a common ground of programming logic with all the other tools. Your goal should be to get to that depth of knowledge ( that common ground ) and that can be done learning any framework no matter whoever is first. Getting close to the "0 level" will allow you to extrapolate and learn anything new, as if you already knew it and you are just remembering, effectively knowing everything without knowing everything. So try to willingly think why the things are the way they are, how they could have been different and more importantly why they are not, how they compare with everything else and what they actually mean.  In short, make logical connections and find logic and anything and everything. It might sound hard, but it is something that can be practiced and become a second nature.

14. How to pick the "right" framework - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7X6fLbdwlc
15. Typecheckers - Assuming you already worked with javascript already, you might have noticed that it does not have any strong types, meaning you can write let a = 1, a = "trex", a = undefined. While it might seem "cool" at first, it will lead to horror bugs that are extremely difficult to debug most of the time, earning javascript its infamous reputation. One thing that mostly solves this issue is typescript because, well, it has types. Most frameworks initialization process comes with typescript out of the box and right now it's an industry standard. The other alternative is JSDoc which provides type inference too and is sometimes chosen over typescript.

    	1. Typescript vs JSDoc - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj8SoTZbCTE

    A. Typescript

16. State management - State management involves handling the data that a program uses or manipulates over time. While it can include variables, databases, or global stores, the concept often pertains to how data is passed, manipulated, and stored within an application's lifecycle. It's not just about the "what" (variables, databases, etc.) but also about the "how" (logic, flow, persistence). There are various ways and libraries that help you keep the state of an app, many of them being specific to their respective framework, but I will list below a few which are framework agnostic. For a more specific setup you will have to search about the state management of your desired framework

    	A. What is state - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8-Xrpl_Uhk&t
    	B. What are side effects - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IIWib5MZKg

    	D. State management in svelte - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIFuMRJT89A


17. Testing advanced - We already touched briefly upon testing but now it's time for something more serious. We will test our entire app in a more professional way, using our newly learned frontend framework. Testing is divided into Unit testing, integration testing and end 2 end testing. Unit and integration testing test functions and chains of functions, basically parts of the app. I would generally recommend vitest and playwright for testing your apps.

Project alert !! - Now that you know state management, typescript and a proper web framework, you should get going some serious projects! Here are a few ideas. Remember to upload them on your github!

Easy
Personal blog - Make a personal blog website with multiple blogs that you can navigate to. You should be able to add new blogs, edit existing ones and remove and add blocks of text ( So one blog can have 3 blocks of text and 1 image, another can have 2 images and 2 blocks of text ). Basically a todo list but harder.

Hard
Build a Path visualizer algorithm - The iteration from the first project cycle, we return to visualizations. You should again go to clement's video and go to the part where he visualizes pathing algorithms. You should implement putting the walls, one of the algorithms visualized and the animations that take place. Good luck!

19. Basics of apis - API's are the thing that allows user accounts, having a database, persistent changes reflected to all users, and more generally building a complex and secure webapp. As a frontend developer you should ideally know a bit of backend in order to understand how the aplication as a whole works, so I strongly recommend checking a backend roadmap and doing at least a small project!!

20. Performance - Performance is obviously important, and in web development there are several metrics you should look out for.

    	1. General performance guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fONene3OIAo 
    A. Measuring performance
    1. Lighthouse - Lighthouse has become the standard approach to measuring web performance. It comes in more shapes, but the 2 most prevalent are lighthouse the website and unlighthouse, a github repo which scans your entire website and gives you the results. Generally lighthouse has more variation in the results while unlighthouse is more stable and gives you

       	A. Unlighthouse - https://github.com/harlan-zw/unlighthouse
       	B. Lighthouse - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyaHwvPWuZU
    2. Profiling - Modern browsers allow developers to use tool in order to measure the performance of a website and called profilers. You will generally be interested in the "network", "performance" and  "memory" tabs. Your app should do well in all these 3 to be considered performant.

           1. Browser dev tools tips you need to know - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcTSqhpm80Y
           2. Chrome dev tools explained - https://youtu.be/gTVpBbFWry8?si=wSPHKr5TqH1Xy93f

       A. Network tab -  This tab shows you all the requests that are coming into an website. You should generally check the networking time when the initial load time is slow, since most bottle necks happen the moment you load images and javascript. Below you have an explanation of the network tab and some of the solutions to speed up your website.

       	1. Network tab explained - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBgfSwX4GDI
       	2. Optimizing your website - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m31FmsqXAo
       B. Performance tab - The place where you can see all aspects of you app performance. If you have an issue definitely give this one a look. It is quite overwhelming at first but you will get it as you continue to code. Make sure to explore it whenever you can !

       	1. Performance tab  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGT4Qe7v0So
       C. Memory tab -  Not used as much, but good to keep in mind if you are at risk of memory leaks

       	1. Memory tab - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvfqnFYXF_8

    B Improving performance

    1. Optimize Assets: One common bottle neck is the amount of data sent to the webpage. One way to deal with this is to minimize the amount of css and javascript sent to the webpage but more importantly your images. You should look into this optimization if your network tab request packages that are too big and your initial page load is slow.

    2. Lazy loading - Lazy loading is basically saying, do not load anything you don't need in that moment. For example if you have 3 images on a landing page, one at the top and 3 at the bottom, you should load only the first image since the other 2 are not visible. The other 2 images should be loaded either when scrolled or after the initial page load is finished. Generally the lazy loading is done javascript framework, but it's still a very good concept to know since it applied in many areas of development ( eg in video games with chunks such as minecraft they do not load everything at once )

    3. Web Workers - Generally used for computationally heavy tasks that might block the main thread. Down below there is a simple video with an extremely good example of when web workers are great and how to use them

    4. Caching - Caching is widely used in programming as a means to optimize repetitive informations. In web development specifically, caching can be done inside the code to save performance at runtime ( so not run the same function 10 times ), or you can do cache inside local storage, by saving values there that you might use later ( the same way cookies are saved ), or via a cdn for static content. There are other caching methods but these are the main ones

    6. Use a CDN - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI9np1LWzqw
    7. Use a framework and tools - Frameworks already implement many of the optimizations listed here and sometimes come with things of their own. Some examples of frameworks that help with optimization are nextjs, astro, gatsby, sveltekit, etc. Some of this are framework specific, others can be used with any framework. So make sure to do your research.

    9. Ultimate way to improve performance - Here's the secret, unless you are lucky, "generic" optimizations won't help that much. You should understand the idea behind these optimizations and be able to apply something similar to your projects. For example, video game chunks are really good for an editor with a high volume of objects, caching can be applied literally everywhere and lazy loading can be done for code, images, behavior, animations etc. So try to isolate problematic parts of your app and see how you can change a number of things about them to not be a problem anymore

    A. Static websites - Websites that are generated on the server and send the same website to all users ( so the same html, css and javascript ). They can be great for websites such as blog where everyone receives the same HTML but not good for highly dynamic content like a webapp, since you have to fetch the data after the initial page load  ( the video below explains very clearly all the tradeoffs ).
    1. Static and dynamic websites - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wFJj94kSTU
    B. Single page applications ( SPA ) - The main point of SPA is sending a very small html page with A LOT of javascript which handles routing. One key difference between an SPA and a static site is that a static site despite receiving the same javascript and html, has to do a full reload when navigating to another route whereas an SPA changes the dom when you navigate to a new route using javascript

23. Picking a meta framework - Whether you are using svelte, react, vue, solid, etc, having a meta framework power your webapp is in most cases beneficial unless you are doing a pet project. Most frameworks have their own respective meta frameworks built on top of them

24. Deployment and Hosting - Deploying a personal project is generally quite easy, most platform have a point and click personal plan where you simply select your github repository and that's it. Some hosting platforms are really well integrated with their products, setting up a CDN for you etc.

25. Becoming a high value frontend developer - Knowing everything in this roadmap will make you a good frontend developer with a wide range of knowledge that can get a job or build a frontend for any product. Although that's a good position to be in there is more. What I saw in the "legendary" kind of developers is that they don't know only their craft, they usually have a multitude of skills that they combine in various ways and most important of all they DIFFERENTIATE themselves. So you should take a niche such as threejs with 3d development or visualizations or data-binding or unusual but pleasant animations and create your own path forward
