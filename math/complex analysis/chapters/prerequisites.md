Prerequisites:

-Strong foundation in Calculus: This includes a solid understanding of limits, derivatives, integrals, sequences, series, and multivariable calculus. Complex analysis relies heavily on these concepts, so a thorough grasp is essential.
-Linear Algebra: Familiarity with vector spaces, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors is crucial. These tools are used extensively in various areas of complex analysis, including conformal mappings and analytic geometry.
