Other resources - Here is a list of alternative resources you can use either to supplement what is already written in this roadmap. They are 2 MIT courses made exactly on this topic, "math for computer science". They cover the college mathematics you should know but don't have the prerequisites or any paths to continue on. But still overall very valuable, I highly recommend checking them out.

How to learn from this roadmap? - Mathematics can be quite a tricky thing to learn sometimes. In the context of computer science, I recommend going first of all through all the concepts and understand AT LEAST the basics of them. You can learn mathematics as you go and bump into different issues and revisit this roadmap for a refresher or to fill gaps you might have.

You will notice this roadmap has multiple main chapters that split into subchapters. I HIGHLY recommend going through the full courses that are linked in many of the main chapters if you want to truly understand that concept, as they cover more than the specific nodes that split from them.

### Prerequisites
* Ideally you should already be familiar with the foundations, pre-calculus and algebra II parts. The math for computer science consists of many college level topics whose roots are in these foundations. That being said, you can learn everything in this roadmap even if you know only 8th grade mathematics. If go through all the resources and complete the courses you should be able to complete it without many issues, albeit harder.

### 1.  Foundations
	- These are core concepts of mathematics everyone should know and have a really solid grasp of. You should go through full courses for each one of them, by learning and completing all exercises which are found in there. 

* **Arithmetic** - These are the basics of any branch of mathematics. Arithmetic deals with numbers and the operations that take place between them such as addition, subtraction , multiplication and division
    * [Arithmetic course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2kZNL0uTXY)
    * [Khan academy arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic)
* **Basic geometry** - Basic geometry studies simple shapes, sizes, angles and their properties in space. Understanding concepts such as lines, angles, points and areas is vital to any developer. Geometry is used in computer graphics, game development, robotics, machine learning and many others. Overall, a strong grasp of basic geometry enhances a developer ability to solve problems
    * [Khan academy geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo)
* **Basic algebra** - Basic algebra equations and inequalities, graphs, polynomials and more core concepts. What basic algebra does is the connection between numbers and their graphical representation. It is about finding the unknown or putting real-life variables into equations and then solve them. It is foundational of many algorithms and the way they were created, being vital for any computer scientist
    * [Algebra for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHeirBPOI6w)
    * [Khan academy algebra basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics)
* **Basic Trigonometry** - An extension of geometry that studies how an angle determines properties in a triangle. Despite sounding simple, trigonometry became a large field in mathematics, having multiple operations such as cos, sin, tangent, etc, with their own properties. Interestingly enough, despite studying only triangles, trigonometric expressions have been found as a solution in really obscure sequences that have no apparent relation to geometry.
    * [Khan academy trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry)
* **Basic probability and statistics** - Probability and statistics might appear useless at first, but they are actually one of the most used branch of mathematics in real life. They are used to interpret data, making inferences, and drawing conclusions based on uncertain or variable information. They are good for both evaluating software, it's behavior and how it should be built, as well as business decisions and what it's more likely to yield a better outcome.
    * [Khan academy High school statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability)

### 2. More mathematical background
- If you already have solid foundations, there are a few more concepts you should be familiar with before diving in the real computer science mathematics. They build upon the foundations and bridge the gap between high-school and college.
* **Algebra II** - Algebra II takes the principles learned in basic algebra to a higher level, introducing advanced polynomial functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, complex numbers, systems of equations and inequalities, as well as sequences and series. You should go through all the resources here, since this topic is found in most of the next concepts you will deal with.
    * [Khan academy algebra 2 course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2)
    -   Advanced Polynomial Functions - Explores the properties and behaviors of polynomial functions, which are found all over mathematics and are used in computer science to calculate time complexities, sums, calculate coordinates systems and more.

        - [Exponential functions growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WMZ7J0wwMI)
    -   Complex Numbers - Complex numbers are a more apart niche of mathematics, they are not so used in your usual computer science work, but they have a lot of niche applications such as quantum computing, signal processing, computer graphics and more. You should at least understand what they are about and their basic properties
        - [Complex numbers fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PcpBw5Hbwo)
    -   Systems of Equations and Inequalities
        - [System of linear inequalities explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xQqwgS3O4U)
    -   Sequences and Series - Sequences and series are a very important topic, as they are found in almost all programs, being almost synonimus with for loops, both in their time complexity and their use. Sequences are used to calculate and predict the result of functions, loops, calculate their complexity and solve a variety of algorithms and problems.
        - [Sequences and series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj89FA-d0f8)
* **Pre-calculus** - Serving as a bridge between algebra and calculus, pre-calculus lays the groundwork for understanding the concepts of limit, continuity, and rate of change, which are pivotal in calculus. In computer science, a strong grasp of pre-calculus is essential to understand concepts such as vectors and matrices, functions and graphs, limits and continuity, all of them being used for a deeper understanding of algorithms and how a program flows

    - Composite and inverse functions - Composing function will be a recurrent theme in your programming journey, as it means passing the output from one function to the next one ( so exactly what you would do in a normal program ) and keeping track of how the output changes from one place to another. Same goes for inverse function, whose role is to map the outputs to the inputs, being useful for a control-z feature for example.

    - Vectors - Vectors are fundamental mathematical objects used extensively in computer science, representing quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Their applications span computer graphics, physics simulations, machine learning, search engines and even problem optimization. They are an important concept found in a lot of random places so it's good to have them under your belt
        - [Vectors by 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs)
    - Matrices - Matrices, in essence, are a mathematical structure. They have been invented initially to solve systems of equations easier, but have evolved to be foundational to neural networks and machine learning and serve as an optimization technique for many algorithms ( eg: computer fibonacci numbers ). They are also EXTREMLY useful to understanding arrays inside arrays, how they behave, how they can be iterated and why data can be easily represented in other ways.

    - Limits and continuity - Limits and continuity are foundational concepts in calculus that deal with understanding the behavior of functions as they approach specific points, and ensuring smoothness and consistency in their behavior. They are not that used specifically in computer science, but can give a very deep understanding of function in general, which are VERY used in this field.

### 3. Essential CS Math Concepts
- Everything to this point has been an introductory part which leads here. The concepts under this chapter are, like the title says, ESSENTIAL to working in computer science. Any gaps here will impact your journey in a negative way, so better make sure to go through all of them.
-   **1. Introduction to proofs**: This is a general introduction to all the mathematical notations one should know to understand the proofs and algorithms presented in the next chapters. There are a lot of proofs especially in the graph part of the course, which need a basic reasoning and understanding of the mathematical notations.

    -   **Induction**: Induction might be the most important part of proofs that you will need in computer science. It is the backbone of dynamic programming ( which is basically induction from previous elements ) but it is also found a lot in graphs and other classes of algorithms. It helps characterize system properties based on what you currently know and it's really really similar with a lot of the thought processes that are involved in designing a system or an algorithm
        - [Induction explained MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HKWUWS-lA&t=1s)

-   **2. Basics Discrete Mathematics** - Discrete mathematics are considered to be the most important part of computer science so if you should take anything from this roadmap, it should definitely be THIS section.
    - **Set theory** - Maybe you won't make immediately the connection between set theory, but after going into the basics of databases or try to merge 2 arrays without duplicates, you will see how helpful it is. Ideas and concepts from sets are also used in certain data structures such as sets ( no pun intended ) and maps. Set theory it is the study of well, sets, which are groups of numbers ( or something else ), and what set theory does is tell you how these groups behave when interacting with each other. Overall a must have in your arsenal.

    -   **Sequences** - By this point you should already know sequences from the algebra part. But I insist going over them again, they are really commonly found in problems and codebases in computer science and have been one of the most useful tools a programmer can have up to this point.
        - [Arithmetics and geometric sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZJdyPkCxuE)
    -   **More on Sums** - In this section, we delve deeper into the realm of sums, exploring the intricate properties of sequences, functions, and their asymptotic behaviors. This exploration is crucial for understanding the efficiency of algorithms, predicting system behaviors, and solving complex computational problems.
        - [Sums formulas and notations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJkIaw2e1Pw)
        *   Sums and Asymptotics - There are sums and products that converge to certain values and when plotted on the graph, they are called asymptotes. Bridging the graphs asymptotes and sums will give you a lot of insight in how these sums work and what they are all about.

    *  **Number theory**: Number theory also called "Queen of mathematics" simply studies numbers and their properties. You already know number theory, or at least a fraction of it without realizing it. There is no real beginning and end to number theory, but there are some properties and algorithms regarding numbers that should be known by everyone, since they are very widely used in computer science and algorithms.

*  **3.A Graph theory** - Going back to the bridges of konigsberg, graph theory was started by the mathematician Leonard Euler trying to solve the problem of the bridges. From there it started a whole branch of mathematics studying graphs, properties of graphs, algorithms for those graphs and how they interact with each other.

* **3.B Automata theory** - Automata theory is quite an interesting topic. It is somewhat of a borderline between computer science and mathematics, describing how a computer works at the lowest level of logic. If put on a timeline, it roughly amounts to: automata theory, then the processor, then assembly, then C and C++, then all the programming languages and ecosystems we know and love today. Automata theory is what gives depth to your programmer thinking and allows you to understand programs and computer much better than before

    -   **State machines**: State machines are a theoretical model that has many parallels to real life. The state machine consists of a state and some rules to transition to another state. That's it! For example, a traffic light could be considered a state machine, since it transitions between red, green and yellow after a condition is met ( x number of seconds has passed ). Understanding state machines will also help you in code, where you can find again the notion of state and transforming state and behavior, but on a higher level than with 0's and 1's. If you want to truly understand how to make a state machine and embed logic into it, follow the automata course linked in automata theory node.

* **3.C Algorithm analysis** - Algorithm analysis is the theoretical part of evaluating and developing algorithms. Note that this chapter will not instantly make you design the next breakthrough, but it will help you a lot in understanding why some algorithms are good, when they are good and how they were created.
  -   **Logarithmic functions & Exponential functions**: The polynomial, logarithmic and exponential functions are the main ways we currently evaluate how an algorithms runs. For about 99% of cases, knowing these 3 will suffice. This section will focus on the logarithmic and exponential ones, since the polynomial is simple X to a power, and will be a refresher for anyone who missed them.

### 4. More Important math concepts
* Congrats on getting so far. At this point you should have all the knowledge you need to go into computer science, although you can still build upon it a lot. This sections contain a lot of really important stuff, but not anything "critical" unless you want to work on a specific math heavy niche.
*   **Calculus I** - Calculus I is the introductory part to the vast world of calculus. It has a wide range of applications, particularly in physics. Calculus is particularly focused on rates of change and motion, having derivatives as its focal point. Calculus can give you the knowledge to prototype a physics engine and understand the underlying mathematical principles that power most of the world.

    - [Calculus khan academy course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)
    * Limits and continuity - Understanding limits is crucial for delving into calculus, as they deal with approaching values and determining the behavior of functions at specific points. Continuity builds upon this, both being critical to understanding what a derivative is.
        * [Limits and continuity explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riXcZT2ICjA)
    * Derivatives - Derivatives represent the rate at which a certain function changes and they are often use to find the area under a curve. They have been a cornerstone in mathematics and are the ground on which the entire subject of analysis was built upon. They can be hard to understand at first, but I left below the most wonderful explanation you can find on the internet about them.
        * [Derivatives explained 3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ)
    * Integrals - Integrals are the inverse operation of derivatives. They are equal to the question "What kind of function derivated would give my f(x)". They also have the interesting connection of measuring the area under the graph of f(x), representing the accumulation of change over time in f(x).
        * [Integrals explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0&list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x&index=8)
    * Differential equations - Differential equations are mathematical equations that involve the rates of change of a variable with respect to another. They are fundamental in modeling and solving problems that involve dynamic systems, where one quantity changes with respect to another.
        * [Differential equations explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4)
*   **Linear Algebra** - Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces. It’s a fundamental area in mathematics with a wide array of applications in computer science, engineering, physics, and various other fields.

    - [Linear algebra khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces)
    * Vector spaces - Vector spaces are a central concept to linear algebra, being in essence a set of vectors that can be added between them and multiplied with scalars, forming a "space". They are an abstract concept that might be harder to grasp at first, but I've left some videos below that explain vector spaces really well.
        * [Vector spaces explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP2ghkO0lSk)
    * Linear transformations - A linear transformation is a function between 2 vector spaces, that preserves the operation of addition and multiplication. It essentially converts one vector space to another, by "streching" it, but not changing the properties of the vector space fundamentally
        * [Linear transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B&index=5)
    * [Determinants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B&index=7)
    * Eigen vectors and eigen values -  An eigenvalue is a scalar that represents how much the eigenvector is stretched or squished during the linear transformation. In simpler terms, it’s a value that, when you apply a specific linear transformation to the eigenvector, the vector only gets scaled (stretched or shrunk), and its direction does not change. An eigenvector is a non-zero vector that only changes by a scalar factor when a corresponding linear transformation is applied. In simpler terms, it’s a vector that doesn’t get knocked off its span (the line it lies on through the origin) when a particular linear transformation is applied; it only gets stretched or shrunk.

-   **Probability and Statistics** - Probabilities and statistics are one of the most useful applied mathematics out there. They analyze the likelihood of data and events respectively. Probabilities are very intertwined with statistics, which analyze the data itself and draw conclusions from it ( which are most of the time probabilities of X thing happening ). They are generally very useful, but we are not going to go in depth on them,

    - Random variables  - A random variable is a variable whose value is subject to variations due to randomness. It assigns a real number to every outcome in the sample space of a random experiment. Random variables provide a bridge between mathematical proofs, notations and random processes
        - [Random variables explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v9w79NhsfI&list=PLU5aQXLWR3_xDN0M2ZeZ_zHIia0e42_3O)
          - Expectation and variance - The expectation (or expected value) of a random variable provides a measure of the "center" or "average" of the distribution of that variable. It gives us an idea of what value we might expect to see if we were to repeat an experiment involving the random variable many times. Variance measures how much the values of a random variable deviate from the expectation, on average. It gives us an idea of the "spread" or "dispersion" of the distribution.

- **Cryptography** -Cryptography is a really old subject, being used even by Julius Caesar in ancient times. It has evolved in many ways and was used extensively in conflicts and wars such as WW2 ( the enigma machine ). Cryptography is strongly tied to mathematics, especially number theory and is being used across software in almost all industries.
