# Linux Roadmap (TLDR Edition)

## Description

This is a roadmap that gives an overview of the key concepts and technologies
you need to know to effectively use Linux. This is a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read)
version of the [Linux Roadmap](/operatingSystems/linux/Linux.md). It includes
only the bare minimum/least boring information to get you started with Linux.

> **Note:** This roadmap is a heavily simplified version of the [full version of
> this roadmap](/operatingSystems/linux/Linux.md). If you want to learn more
> about Linux, I highly recommend you check it out. It was mainly made with the
> goal of helping people get the bare basics before diving into the full version
> of the roadmap.
>
> To Keep it short, I will only be covering Debian-based distros (e.g., Ubuntu,
> Pop!OS, Linux Mint, etc.).
