# Package Management in Debian-based Distros

Package management is the way to handle software installation, updating, and removal. In Debian-based distributions, `apt-get` and `dpkg` are common tools for package management.

- `apt-get update` - updates the list of available packages.
- `apt-get upgrade` - upgrades all installed packages.
- `apt-get install <package>` - installs a package.
- `apt-get remove <package>` - removes a package.
