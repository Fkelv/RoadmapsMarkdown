# 9. User and Group Management

- User and group management in Linux forms a key aspect of system
  administration. It involves creating, deleting, and configuring user and group
  accounts. User management is critical for controlling access to a system's
  resources, ensuring only authorized individuals have access. Group management
  allows grouping users together for shared access rights to files and
  directories. Together they help secure the system, optimize resource
  allocation, and facilitate collaborative operations.
